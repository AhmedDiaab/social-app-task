Task: Social Media Authentication and Post API with Node.js

Requirements:
1. Develop a RESTful API for social media authentication and post management using Node.js.
2. Implement user authentication using popular social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Google) to allow users to sign in with their social media accounts.
3. Support user registration using email/password and provide password reset functionality.
4. Implement secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT, OAuth) for user sessions.
5. Allow authenticated users to create, retrieve, update, and delete posts.
6. Implement validation checks for the post content and associated data (e.g., images, tags).
7. Provide pagination and sorting options for retrieving posts.
8. Support user interactions with posts (e.g., liking, commenting).
9. Use a database of your choice (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) to store user information and post data.
10. Implement error handling and logging for the API.
11. Write unit tests to ensure the functionality and correctness of the API endpoints.
12. Implement input sanitization to prevent common security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
13. Implement rate limiting or other security measures to protect against abuse or denial-of-service attacks.

Details:
1. Create a new Node.js project with a suitable name.
2. Set up the project dependencies and package.json file.
3. Create an Express.js server to handle HTTP requests.
4. Implement authentication routes and logic for social media login (e.g., Facebook, Google) using their respective authentication APIs.
5. Implement user registration routes and logic, allowing users to sign up using their email and password.
6. Set up secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT, OAuth) to handle user sessions and ensure authorized access to protected routes.
7. Connect to the chosen database and set up the required schemas or tables to store user information and post data.
8. Define routes and logic for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting posts.
9. Implement middleware to validate post content and associated data, ensuring they meet the necessary criteria.
10. Implement pagination and sorting options for retrieving posts to improve usability.
11. Allow users to interact with posts, such as liking or commenting on them.
12. Handle errors appropriately and provide meaningful error messages in the API responses.
13. Set up logging to record API activities and errors.
14. Write unit tests using a testing framework of your choice (e.g., Jest, Mocha) to verify the functionality of the API endpoints.
15. Implement input sanitization using a library or custom middleware to prevent common security vulnerabilities.
16. Add rate limiting or other security measures to protect against abuse or denial-of-service attacks.
17. Document the API endpoints, their input/output format, and any required headers or authentication mechanisms.

Note: Ensure you install any required Node.js packages, follow coding best practices, and use proper error handling techniques throughout the development process. Additionally, consider security aspects such as data encryption, secure session management, and secure handling of user authentication tokens.
